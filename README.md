# Fraudpheus
## Origin
So... it's named Fraudpheus cause its main purpose was to communicate with
people who are accused of committing fraud in Summer of Making program made by Hack Club.
<br><br>
We were receiving lots of DMs, and even emails from angry people, some were searching
other ways to reach us by finding our social medias.
<br>
To make it more private and safer for us, We've created a bot which keeps our identities hidden

## Features
- Communicating between people who DM your bot and members of certain channel
- AI-powered responses that help handle common queries automatically (with human approval)
- Smart triages that categorize and prioritize incoming messages
- Custom "hidden" messages by typing `!` at the start of reply - won't be sent as DM,
stays in the channel for team notes
- Macros for quick responses to frequently asked questions
- Keeping track of which cases are resolved and which not by marking threads as completed
- Deleting threads to keep the channel clean
- Transferring files between channel members and people DMing the bot 
- AI powered thread resolving ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ "i'm so cool ~ Arnav"
- Integration with wakatime/hackatime fraud detectors
- Backup chats feature

## Usage
- Type `/fdchat @user msg` where `user` is a mention of someone (ping) and `msg` is your desired message. 
It will send a message to the person you mentioned
- Type `!msg` in existing thread of your channel to have a hidden message which won't be sent to chosen user.
- Clicking `Mark as Completed` marks the thread as completed and puts a checkmark as a reaction.
- Clicking `Delete thread` deletes the thread both from the channel and from the db.
- New messages started by users DMing your bot, or answering to completed threads will appear as a new thread.

## Setup
### Slack App
Create a Slack App with these scopes:<br><br>
<b>Bot token scopes</b>
- `channels:history`
- `channels:read`
- `chat:write`
- `chat:write.customize`
- `chat:write.public`
- `commands`
- `files:read`
- `files:write`
- `groups:history`
- `im:history`
- `im:read`
- `im:write`
- `reactions:read`
- `reactions:write`
- `users:read`
<br><br>

<b>User scopes</b>
- `channels:history`
- `channels:read`
- `channels:write`
- `chat:write`
- `im:history`
- `im:read`
- `users:read`

<br>

Add a slash command, initial one is `fdchat`, you can change it in code though.
<br>
Make sure to turn the option `Escape channels, users, and links sent to your app` on.


### Airtable
You need to create a database on Airtable.
<br>
You need to have at least two tables.
- `Active Threads`
- `Completed Threads`

They have to include these fields:<br><br>
<b>Active Threads</b>
- `user_id` - single line text
- `channel` - single line text
- `created_at` - created time
- `last_activity` - last modified time
- `message_ts` - single line text
- `thread_ts` - single line text
- `funny_field` - single line text
<br><br>

<b>Completed Threads</b>
- `user_id` - single line text
- `channel` - single line text
- `completed_at` - created time
- `message_ts` - single line text
- `thread_ts` - single line text


### env
Create a `.env` file in the roof directory of this project (outside of `src/`)
<br>
Fill it out based on `example.env` file<br>
<i>User token is used for deleting messages of other users, as only admins can do that. If you
don't have admin privileges, fill it - but keep in mind your bot won't delete all messages when destroying threads</i>


### Preparing python stuff
```
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that your bot should be ready to run!<br>
Just remember to add that bot to the channel
